# 🚀 Astro Pi — Mission Space Lab (2025–2026)

Welcome to our Mission Space Lab project! This repository contains our Python program that will run on the **Astro Pi** computers aboard the International Space Station.

Our goal is to design a scientific experiment, collect data using the Astro Pi sensors, and analyse the results back on Earth.

## 📌 Mission Overview

Mission Space Lab challenges teams to:

- Design a **scientific experiment** that uses the Astro Pi hardware.
- Write a **Python program** that runs fully automatically on the ISS.
- Collect data during a maximum **3-hour runtime**.
- Analyse the results and produce a **scientific report**.

## ✅ Allowed Python Modules

Only the following non-standard modules are allowed in Mission Space Lab.  
Your program **must not import anything outside this list** (besides the Python standard library):

```
Skyfield
astro_pi_orbit
picamzero
GPIO Zero
NumPy
SciPy
pandas
logzero
Matplotlib
Pillow
OpenCV
exif
scikit-learn
scikit-image
reverse-geocoder
sense_hat```

## 📜 Mission Rules (Simplified)

### 🧪 Experiment Requirements
- Program must run **autonomously** without user input.
- Maximum execution time: **3 hours**.
- Experiment must use Astro Pi sensors or the camera **meaningfully**.
- Program must save data or images for analysis.

### 💻 Coding Rules
- No installing additional Python packages.
- No internet/network usage of any kind.
- No manual camera ISO, exposure, or white balance settings.
- Avoid high CPU usage — include pauses where possible.
- Output files must remain within the storage limit (approx. 3GB).

### 🔒 Safety Rules
- No writing outside allowed directories.
- No modifying system settings.
- No bright flashing patterns/images.
- Code must not risk the hardware or crew.

### 📝 Reporting Requirements
After the ISS run, teams must write a **scientific report** summarising:

- Objective  
- Method  
- Data analysis  
- Conclusions
